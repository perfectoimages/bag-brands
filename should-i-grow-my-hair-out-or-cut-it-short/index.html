<p>And believe my experience they can be skeptical and even openly hostile when you start thinking about cutting your hair. Growing your hair out doesnt have to mean deleting your barbers phone number. Believe or not some of us make the decision to actually keep our hair short for a good while after the big chop. What will happen is your hair will grow but wont get very much longer if at all since the ends. Pin On Beyer.</p>
