<p>Dead ends occur when the strands of your hair start developing split ends once the hair cuticle gets damaged and wears off. When you trim or cut your hair you only reduce the length of the tips. Its important to highlight that cutting your hair frequently will not make it grow any faster but you will help it grow healthier and stronger as youll be getting rid of any damaged ends.
