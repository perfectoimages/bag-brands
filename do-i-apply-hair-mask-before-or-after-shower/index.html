<p>Its best to put on a mask after washing your face and its even better to do after a shower because the steam helps to clean out your pores before you put all that good stuff on them. This will give the mask the time it needs to work its magic. After wearing your mask for the necessary timeframe rinse it out in the shower. Masks work best when theyre applied to clean dry skin and since youre washing your face after the shower thats also the time to apply a mask.
