<p>Unless the mother has a recessive blond gene which combines with the fathers recessive blond trait the child will be light-haired. It is a dominant trait and less likely to blend with lighter pigments than brown hair. For the most part the idea of a single brownblond gene matches how hair colors are really passed down.
