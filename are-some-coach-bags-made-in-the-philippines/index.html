<p>Since its inception more than 70 years ago Coach Philippines has manufactured grade-A leather goods that are on par with other luxury fashion brands. Some used to be made in the United States and the Dominican Republic. BTW Coach is now making bags in the Philippines I hate to keep bothering you about this bag I just want to make absolutely sure it is authentic and not just a really good fake due in large fact to the differences in it and other Coach products I have. Some are made in Turkey Vietnam India and Philippines. Nwt Coach Reversible City Tote Tote Bags Coach.</p>
