<p><strong>Bacteria That Eats Plastic Bags</strong>, The forget about it mentality pervades society and they ignore a massive problem that plagues marine life. In fact some of their gut bacteria even seemed to do better eating plastic. Deducing that the hungry larvae must have digested the plastic somehow he and his team analyzed their gut bacteria and found a few that could use plastic as their only carbon source.
