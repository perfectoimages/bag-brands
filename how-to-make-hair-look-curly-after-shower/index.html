<p>To make wavy hair curlier scrunch your hair while in the shower and then diffuse instead of air dry so that it dries quicker and tighter. If you dont want to hang out in the shower waiting the 30 minutes for it to process try taking a bath or hopping out and coming back later to finish. As you step outta the shower reach for this microfiber towel and scrunch-squeeze your hair a couple of times in order to absorb extra moisture while reintroducing your natural curl pattern back to your hair.
