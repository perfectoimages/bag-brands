<p>Apple Store employees filed the class-action lawsuit in 2013 claiming the company was violating California law by not paying them for the time it took to check their bags. Apple agreed to pay 299 million to almost 15000 retail workers in a deal that would end a suit in California federal court claiming the company failed to pay them for mandatory bag checks. The bill could run north of 60 million but Apple will be able to dispute on a case-by-case basis. Apple claimed the bag searches were necessary to make sure workers were not hiding stolen electronic devices in their bags and argued in court that anyone who didnt like the policy could choose not to bring bags to work.
