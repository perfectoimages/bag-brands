<p>Author of Curly Girl. I suggest using a molding paste when your hair is still wet to smooth down frizz. It usually goes like that after a brush it or if im in a rush and have to use a hair dryer recently my hair has been going wavy largely since i started using tea tree alberto balsam and now when i get out of the shower i leave it - dont even combbrush it and i get decent waves its when i brush it it goes like that so im not using a brush so much any more and my hairs. You wont need to deep condition your curls are often and will need a lighter deep conditioner when you do. Your waves are more likely to have low porosity.</p>
