<p>If you have normal hair and dont suffer from dryness or oiliness you have the luxury of washing your hair whenever you feel like you need to. If you have curly hair you can try a high bun on the top of your crown and not sideways or back so that it doesn t interfere with your sleep and holds shape till morning. This helps distribute the natural oil from your scalp throughout the rest of your hair. But then in the morning when i take my hair tie out my hair is in a funky pineapple shape xD so i spritz water into it and move it around to make a neater afro. This helps distribute the natural oil from your scalp throughout the rest of your hair.</p>
