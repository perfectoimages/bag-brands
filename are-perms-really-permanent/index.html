<p>A perm short for the word permanent is the hairstyling process used to change the texture of hair to a curlier or wavier texture. This process permanently alters your hairs anatomy to resemble that of curly hair giving hair permanent curls that dont require heat tools or curlers. Perms though called permanents are not actually permanent. If your hair isnt coloured a perm at a reputable salon should have no damaging effect on your hair at all.

<p>Perm is a hairstyle made up of curls or waves permanently set into the hair and lasts 4-6 weeks on men. Perms also known as permanent waves is a process where hair is treated with chemicals to alter its structure. The disulfide bonds are key players for the curls that a perm produces. Its more of a semi-permanent perm which has been a big attraction for my first-time clients. Pin On Before And After Perm.</p>
