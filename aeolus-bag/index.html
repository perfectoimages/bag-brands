<p>Odysseus pleads with Aeolus for another bag of winds but the king refuses because he believes Odysseus and his men must be cursed by the gods. Aeolus was a name given to three mythical characters but their myths are deeply intertwined in such a fashion that the characters are often difficult to tell apart. Aeolus is not punished.
